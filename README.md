# WP-Elementor
Fast website on WP + Elementor plugin

1) Favicon  =  https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
You can quickly create a stylish favicon using text.

2) There was a choice - meanwhile, make a site from 0 to html or use CMS.
After communicating with the client, he wanted to make changes to the site, he needed a simple admin panel, the choice fell on WordPress.

3) I have already made a large number of sites on WordPress, and had my own various templates. I heard about the Elementor plugin, but I have not used it before, it is free and has interesting features. I decided to try it.

4) I needed high-quality photos.

5) I decided to focus on the main page and divide it into 6 logical elements.

6) Main - similar to LP-site, 
a) large photo + Name Surname 
b) Gallery of 3 photos with a link to all photos. 
c) next speech 
d) Press (quotes) 
e) Biography (short + video) 
g) contacts.

7) Menu: Home, Biography, Gallery, Video, Repertoire.
